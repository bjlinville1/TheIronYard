Instead, you could write a .each that corresponds to variables assigned to the ranges of allowable flows from one state to another, and pull your desired links out of an array when they match your criteria. This means you would write ONE loop, and then only have to input transitions into variable arrays that represent each state.(which would be very easy to copy and/or fill in ranges from one variable array to the next)
